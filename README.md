## 📌 Insights Summary

1. **Layoffs peaked between late 2022 and early 2023**, likely due to post-pandemic correction, rise in AI/automation, and inflation-related cost cutting.
2. **Industries most reliant on tech (e.g. consumer services)** saw consistent layoffs as they adapted to shifting tools and trends.
3. **Large companies had the highest layoff numbers**, often tied to team size and restructuring needs.
4. **Post-IPO and acquired companies laid off more staff** than seed or early-stage startups, possibly due to investor or market pressures.
5. **U.S. companies led in layoffs**, but the impact was global.
